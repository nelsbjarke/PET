# PET
This repository contains the scripts used to generate the CMIP derived ensemble of potential and reference evapotranspiration. 

In order to run the scripts contained herein, use the PMPET_run.py script to wrap the PMPET_v3.py script which contains all of the functions to estimate 
potential and reference evapotranspiration. Reference evapotranspiration formulation uses the FAO 56 Penman-Monteith guidelines. Further description of the 
scripts and their functions can be found at the scientific data manuscript: Bjarke, N., Barsugli, J., and Livneh, B. Ensemble of CMIP6 derived reference and potential evapotranspiration with radiative 
and advective components. (2003) Scientific Data.
